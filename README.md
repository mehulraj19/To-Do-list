# To-Do-list

I have used express,body-parser in my servers for the functionality of the website. 
The new thing here is that I have used .ejs file instead of .html file since it makes my website even more dynamic and really helps to reduce the code that are being used again and again.
Moreover, I have also made user-defined module and has exported to my server as we do for other modeules(for example, express).
